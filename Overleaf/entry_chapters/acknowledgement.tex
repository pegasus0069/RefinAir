\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
I acknowledge my profound indebtedness and express sincere gratitude to my senior project supervisor Dr. Mahady Hasan, Head of Department, Department of Computer Science & Engineering, School of Engineering, Technology & Sciences, Independent University, Bangladesh - who not only showered us with guidance, supervision, and valuable suggestions at all stages to carry out the project, but also provided us with a fully funded thesis. Without his inspiration and kind support the study could not be carried out. I am thankful to him for giving me the opportunity to work under his supervision and am proud to have him as my supervisor for the senior project .

I also would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to FabLab IUB for creating a space with qualitiful research opportunities and providing me with all the equipment, facility and support that was needed during the process of execution of the project. 

My utmost appreciation to all the developers who built libraries for the sensors used in this project. Without their contribution my project would have been incomplete.

Finally, earnest gratitude to the Almighty, Allah (S.W.T), for giving me good health for which I could complete this report in due time. Also, my family members and friends, who supported me with ideas and suggestions.
